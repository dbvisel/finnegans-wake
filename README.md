finnegans-wake
==============

An easy way to read both Finnegans Wake and the FWEET annotations. This HTML page will load pages from Finnegans Wake 
(from http://www.trentu.ca/faculty/jjoyce/) and FWEET (http://www.fweet.org) in iframes on the same page. Buttons in
the upper left and right corners let you go forward or backwards a page.

If you invoke this like this:

finneganswake.html?page=250

it will attempt to go to page 250; otherwise, it starts at the beginning. 

I've tested this in Mac browsers and it works reasonably well; I don't know how it will look on anything else. I am
not much of a programmer and this was put together extremely quickly; this could certainly be improved. There are a
couple of spots where it runs into trouble – pages that don't exist – but keep pressing the forward or back buttons
and you'll get past it.
