finnegans-wake
==============

An easy way to read both James Joyce's _Finnegans Wake_ and the FWEET annotations. This HTML page will load pages from _Finnegans Wake_ 
(from http://www.trentu.ca/faculty/jjoyce/) and FWEET (http://www.fweet.org) in iframes on the same page. This will work
either locally or remotely. Buttons in the upper left and right corners let you go forward or backwards a page. Links in 
both sites work, though clicking them may cause the pages to get out of synch. 

A version is online here:

http://withhiddennoise.net/tempo/finneganswake.html

If you invoke this with a page number like this:

http://withhiddennoise.net/tempo/finneganswake.html?page=250

it will attempt to go to page 250; otherwise, it starts at the beginning. 

I've tested this in Mac browsers and it works reasonably well; I don't know how it will look on anything else. I am
not much of a programmer and this was put together extremely quickly; this could certainly be improved. There are a
couple of spots where it runs into trouble – pages that don't exist – but keep pressing the forward or back buttons
and you'll get past it. A couple of the wider pages of the _Wake_ cause troubles as well.

I am not responsible, of course, for either the online _Finnegans Wake_ or FWEET, though I'm extremely grateful that 
both of them are there!
